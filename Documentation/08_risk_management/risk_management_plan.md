# Risk Management Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the risk management strategy for Surviving Gloomspire, ensuring potential issues are identified, assessed, and mitigated throughout the project lifecycle.

## Risk Categories

### 1. Technical Risks
- **Engine Limitations**
  - *Impact*: High
  - *Probability*: Medium
  - *Mitigation*: Regular engine updates, prototype early
  - *Contingency*: Custom engine modifications

- **Performance Issues**
  - *Impact*: High
  - *Probability*: High
  - *Mitigation*: Regular profiling, performance budgets
  - *Contingency*: Optimization sprints

- **Integration Challenges**
  - *Impact*: Medium
  - *Probability*: Medium
  - *Mitigation*: Clear API contracts, integration tests
  - *Contingency*: Dedicated integration sprints

### 2. Project Risks
- **Scope Creep**
  - *Impact*: High
  - *Probability*: High
  - *Mitigation*: Strict change control, MVP focus
  - *Contingency*: Feature descoping plan

- **Schedule Slippage**
  - *Impact*: High
  - *Probability*: Medium
  - *Mitigation*: Buffer time, critical path analysis
  - *Contingency*: Additional resources

- **Resource Constraints**
  - *Impact*: Medium
  - *Probability*: Low
  - *Mitigation*: Resource leveling, cross-training
  - *Contingency*: Outsourcing options

### 3. Asset Risks
- **Asset Delivery Delays**
  - *Impact*: Medium
  - *Probability*: Medium
  - *Mitigation*: Clear milestones, regular check-ins
  - *Contingency*: Placeholder system

- **Quality Inconsistencies**
  - *Impact*: Medium
  - *Probability*: Medium
  - *Mitigation*: Style guides, validation tools
  - *Contingency*: Asset rework sprints

### 4. Team Risks
- **Knowledge Silos**
  - *Impact*: High
  - *Probability*: Medium
  - *Mitigation*: Documentation, pair programming
  - *Contingency*: Knowledge transfer sessions

- **Team Burnout**
  - *Impact*: High
  - *Probability*: Medium
  - *Mitigation*: Sustainable pace, work-life balance
  - *Contingency*: Temporary staffing

## Risk Management Process

### 1. Identification
- **When**: Continuously throughout the project
- **Methods**:
  - Brainstorming sessions
  - Retrospectives
  - Risk checklists
  - Expert consultation

### 2. Assessment
- **Risk Matrix**:
  ```
  | Impact \ Probability | Low | Medium | High |
  |----------------------|-----|---------|------|
  | High                | 4   | 8       | 12   |
  | Medium              | 3   | 6       | 9    |
  | Low                 | 1   | 2       | 3    |
  ```
- **Scoring**:
  - 1-4: Low priority
  - 5-8: Medium priority
  - 9-12: High priority

### 3. Response Planning
- **Avoid**: Change plans to eliminate risk
- **Mitigate**: Reduce probability/impact
- **Transfer**: Shift risk to third party
- **Accept**: Acknowledge and monitor

### 4. Monitoring & Control
- **Risk Register**: Centralized tracking
- **Review Cadence**: Bi-weekly risk reviews
- **Reporting**: Risk dashboard for stakeholders

## Risk Register

| ID | Risk | Category | Impact | Probability | Score | Status | Owner | Mitigation |
|----|------|----------|--------|-------------|-------|--------|-------|------------|
| R1 | Engine limitations | Technical | High | Medium | 8 | Active | Lead Dev | Regular engine updates |
| R2 | Scope creep | Project | High | High | 12 | Active | PM | Strict change control |
| R3 | Asset delays | Asset | Medium | Medium | 6 | Watch | Art Lead | Clear milestones |
| R4 | Team burnout | Team | High | Medium | 9 | Monitor | Leads | Workload balancing |

## Communication Plan

### 1. Reporting
- **Daily**: Standup callouts
- **Weekly**: Risk report in team meeting
- **Monthly**: Executive summary to stakeholders

### 2. Escalation Path
1. Team member → Tech Lead
2. Tech Lead → Project Manager
3. Project Manager → Stakeholders

## Tools & Templates

### Risk Assessment Form
```
Risk ID: [Auto-generated]
Date Identified: [Date]
Description: [Clear description]
Category: [Technical/Project/Asset/Team]
Impact: [High/Medium/Low]
Probability: [High/Medium/Low]
Score: [Impact × Probability]
Owner: [Name]
Mitigation Strategy: [Plan]

Status: [New/In Progress/Resolved/Closed]
```

### Risk Review Meeting Template
1. Review previous risks
2. Identify new risks
3. Update risk scores
4. Adjust mitigation plans
5. Assign actions
6. Document decisions

## Continuous Improvement

### 1. Lessons Learned
- Document risk management successes/failures
- Update risk checklists
- Refine assessment criteria

### 2. Process Refinement
- Regularly review risk management process
- Incorporate team feedback
- Stay updated with industry best practices
