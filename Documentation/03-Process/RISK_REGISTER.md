# Risk Register

## Overview
This document tracks potential risks to the project, their impact, likelihood, and mitigation strategies.

## Risk Assessment Scale

### Impact
- **Low**: Minor impact on timeline/quality
- **Medium**: Noticeable impact, but manageable
- **High**: Significant impact on project success
- **Critical**: Threat to project viability

### Probability
- **Unlikely**: < 20% chance of occurring
- **Possible**: 20-50% chance
- **Likely**: 50-80% chance
- **Almost Certain**: > 80% chance

## Risk Register

### 1. Technical Complexity
- **Description**: Core systems may have unforeseen technical challenges
- **Impact**: High
- **Probability**: Possible
- **Mitigation**:
  - Build technical prototypes early
  - Break down complex tasks
  - Allocate buffer time
- **Owner**: Lead Engineer
- **Status**: Monitoring

### 2. Performance Issues
- **Description**: Game may not meet performance targets on target hardware
- **Impact**: High
- **Probability**: Likely
- **Mitigation**:
  - Regular performance testing
  - Profile early and often
  - Optimize based on real data
- **Owner**: Technical Director
- **Status**: Active

### 3. Scope Creep
- **Description**: Uncontrolled changes or growth in project scope
- **Impact**: Medium
- **Probability**: Likely
- **Mitigation**:
  - Strict change control
  - Regular scope reviews
  - Clear prioritization
- **Owner**: Project Manager
- **Status**: Monitoring

### 4. Resource Constraints
- **Description**: Insufficient team members or hardware
- **Impact**: Medium
- **Probability**: Possible
- **Mitigation**:
  - Resource planning
  - Cross-training
  - Contingency hiring
- **Owner**: Studio Head
- **Status**: Watch

### 5. Integration Issues
- **Description**: Problems when integrating different systems
- **Impact**: High
- **Probability**: Possible
- **Mitigation**:
  - Define clear interfaces
  - Integration testing
  - Regular syncs between teams
- **Owner**: Lead Engineer
- **Status**: Active

### 6. Third-Party Dependencies
- **Description**: Issues with external libraries or tools
- **Impact**: Medium
- **Probability**: Possible
- **Mitigation**:
  - Vet dependencies early
  - Have fallback options
  - Stay updated on versions
- **Owner**: Technical Director
- **Status**: Watch

### 7. Knowledge Silos
- **Description**: Critical knowledge held by few team members
- **Impact**: High
- **Probability**: Possible
- **Mitigation**:
  - Documentation
  - Pair programming
  - Knowledge sharing sessions
- **Owner**: Team Leads
- **Status**: Active

## Risk Review Process
1. **Weekly Review**: Team discusses active risks
2. **Monthly Assessment**: Full risk reassessment
3. **Trigger-based**: Immediate review when risks materialize
4. **Post-Mortem**: After major milestones

## Risk Response Strategies
- **Avoid**: Change plans to avoid the risk
- **Mitigate**: Take steps to reduce impact/probability
- **Transfer**: Shift risk to third party
- **Accept**: Acknowledge and monitor
