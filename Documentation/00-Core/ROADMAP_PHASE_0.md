# Surviving Gloomspire - Phase 0: Foundation

## Overview
Phase 0 focuses on establishing the core technical foundations and essential game systems. This phase prioritizes stability, performance, and extensibility to support future development.

## Objectives
1. Implement core infrastructure systems
2. Establish development workflows and standards
3. Create foundational gameplay systems
4. Set up testing and quality assurance processes

## Milestones

### 1. Core Infrastructure
- [ ] **Event System** (`IEventSystem`)
  - Basic publish-subscribe implementation
  - Event type definitions
  - Priority system
  - Unit tests

- [ ] **Logging System** (`ILoggingSystem`)
  - Core logging functionality
  - Log levels (Debug, Info, Warning, Error, Critical)
  - File output with rotation
  - Performance monitoring hooks

- [ ] **Configuration System** (`IConfigSystem`)
  - Settings management
  - Platform-specific configurations
  - User preferences
  - Runtime updates

### 2. Core Game Systems
- [ ] **Rules Engine** (`IRulesEngine`)
  - Core rule resolution
  - Basic game mechanics
  - Effect system integration

- [ ] **Effect System** (`IEffectSystem`)
  - Base effect class
  - Status effects
  - Combat effects
  - Environmental effects

- [ ] **Dice System** (`IDiceSystem`)
  - Core dice rolling mechanics
  - Modifier system
  - Critical success/failure
  - Probability calculations

### 3. Development Infrastructure
- [ ] Project Setup
  - Source control structure
  - Build system
  - Dependency management
  - Documentation standards

- [ ] CI/CD Pipeline
  - Automated builds
  - Unit testing
  - Code quality checks
  - Deployment processes

### 4. Technical Prototypes
- [ ] Core Game Loop
  - Basic game state management
  - Input handling
  - Frame timing

- [ ] Save System Prototype
  - Basic save/load functionality
  - Data serialization
  - Version control

## Success Criteria
1. All core systems are implemented and unit tested
2. Basic game loop is functional
3. Development environment is set up and documented
4. Performance metrics meet target requirements
5. Code quality metrics are established and met

## Dependencies
- Unreal Engine environment setup
- Development tools and licenses
- Team onboarding completed

## Risks and Mitigations
1. **Technical Complexity**
   - Risk: Core systems may have unforeseen complexities
   - Mitigation: Build small, testable components first

2. **Performance Issues**
   - Risk: Core systems may impact performance
   - Mitigation: Implement performance monitoring early

3. **Scope Creep**
   - Risk: Feature creep in foundational systems
   - Mitigation: Strict adherence to phase goals

## Timeline
- **Duration**: 12 weeks
- **Start Date**: [To be determined]
- **End Date**: [To be determined]
