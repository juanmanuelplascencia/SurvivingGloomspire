## Interface

```cpp
/**
 * Rule evaluation context
 */
struct FRuleContext
{
    UObject* Source = nullptr;
    UObject* Target = nullptr;
    TMap<FName, FVariant> Parameters;
    // ... other context data
};

/**
 * Base interface for all rules
 */
class IRule
{
public:
    virtual ~IRule() = default;
    
    /**
     * Evaluate the rule with the given context
     * @return True if the rule applies, false otherwise
     */
    virtual bool Evaluate(const FRuleContext& Context) const = 0;
    
    /**
     * Get the priority of this rule (higher executes first)
     */
    virtual int32 GetPriority() const = 0;
};

/**
 * Rules engine interface
 */
class IRulesEngine
{
public:
    virtual ~IRulesEngine() = default;
    
    // Rule Management
    virtual void AddRule(TSharedPtr<IRule> Rule, FName RuleSet = NAME_None) = 0;
    virtual void RemoveRule(TSharedPtr<IRule> Rule) = 0;
    virtual void ClearRules(FName RuleSet = NAME_None) = 0;
    
    // Rule Evaluation
    virtual bool EvaluateRules(const FRuleContext& Context, FName RuleSet = NAME_None) const = 0;
    virtual TArray<TSharedPtr<IRule>> GetMatchingRules(const FRuleContext& Context, FName RuleSet = NAME_None) const = 0;
    
    // Batch Operations
    virtual void AddRules(const TArray<TSharedPtr<IRule>>& Rules, FName RuleSet = NAME_None) = 0;
    virtual void EvaluateBatch(const TArray<FRuleContext>& Contexts, FName RuleSet = NAME_None) = 0;
    
    // Performance Optimization
    virtual void PrewarmRuleSet(FName RuleSet) = 0;
    virtual void ClearCache() = 0;
};
```

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

1. **Rule Manager**
   - Manages rule registration and lookup
   - Handles rule sets and namespacing
   - Implements rule caching

2. **Rule Evaluator**
   - Efficient rule matching and evaluation
   - Priority-based execution
   - Context management

3. **Rule Factories**
   - Creates rules from data assets
   - Handles serialization/deserialization

### Performance Considerations
- Rule caching for frequently evaluated rules
- Optimized data structures for rule lookup
- Parallel evaluation of independent rules
- Minimal memory allocation during evaluation

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Simple Rule
```cpp
class FDamageReductionRule : public IRule
{
public:
    virtual bool Evaluate(const FRuleContext& Context) const override
    {
        // Check if target has damage reduction
        if (auto* Target = Cast<IGameCharacter>(Context.Target))
        {
            return Target->HasDamageReduction();
        }
        return false;
    }
    
    virtual int32 GetPriority() const override { return 100; }
};

// Register the rule
auto Rule = MakeShared<FDamageReductionRule>();
RulesEngine->AddRule(Rule, TEXT("Combat"));
```

### Evaluating Rules
```cpp
FRuleContext Context;
Context.Source = Player;
Context.Target = Enemy;
Context.Parameters.Add("Damage", FVariant(25.0f));

bool bShouldApplyDamage = RulesEngine->EvaluateRules(Context, TEXT("Combat"));
if (bShouldApplyDamage)
{
    // Apply damage
}
```

### Rule Sets
```cpp
// Define rule sets
RulesEngine->AddRule(DamageRule, TEXT("Combat"));
RulesEngine->AddRule(HealingRule, TEXT("Combat"));
RulesEngine->AddRule(MovementRule, TEXT("Movement"));

// Evaluate specific rule set
bool bCanMove = RulesEngine->EvaluateRules(MoveContext, TEXT("Movement"));
```

## Best Practices

1. **Rule Design**
   - Keep rules focused and single-purpose
   - Use composition for complex conditions
   - Document rule behavior and dependencies

2. **Performance**
   - Use rule sets to minimize evaluation scope
   - Cache frequently used rules
   - Avoid expensive operations in rule evaluation

3. **Debugging**
   - Add descriptive names to rules
   - Include context in rule evaluation
   - Log important rule evaluations

## Configuration

Rules can be configured via data assets or JSON configuration:

```json
{
    "Rules": [
        {
            "Type": "DamageReduction",
            "Priority": 100,
            "RuleSet": "Combat",
            "Parameters": {
                "ReductionType": "Physical",
                "Amount": 5
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

## Integration

The Rules Engine integrates with other systems:
- **Effect System**: Applies game effects based on rules
- **Combat System**: Handles combat resolution
- **Ability System**: Validates and modifies abilities
- **AI System**: Makes decisions based on game rules
