# Event System (IEventSystem)

## Overview
The Event System (`IEventSystem`) is the backbone of the game's reactive architecture, enabling decoupled communication between game systems through a publish-subscribe pattern.

## Core Features
- Event publishing and subscription
- Type-safe event dispatching
- Event filtering and prioritization
- Asynchronous event handling
- Event queuing and batching
- Debug visualization
- Event validation and security
- Event serialization and persistence
- Event history and recovery
- Performance monitoring

## Event Types
- **Game Events**: Player actions, combat events, game state changes
- **UI Events**: User interface interactions
- **System Events**: Engine-level notifications
- **Network Events**: Multiplayer synchronization
- **Debug Events**: Development and debugging information
- **Performance Events**: Runtime metrics and profiling

## API Reference

### Event Structure
```typescript
interface IGameEvent {
    id: string;
    type: EventType;
    timestamp: Date;
    priority: EventPriority;
    data: any;
    source: string;
    target: string[];
    metadata: EventMetadata;
    validation: EventValidation;
    recovery: EventRecovery;
}
```

### Subscribing to Events
```cpp
// Example: Subscribing to an event
auto subscription = EventSystem::Subscribe<PlayerMovedEvent>(
    [](const PlayerMovedEvent& event) {
        // Handle event
    },
    Priority::Normal
);
```

### Publishing Events
```cpp
// Example: Publishing an event
PlayerMovedEvent event{playerId, newPosition};
EventSystem::Publish(event);
```

## Performance Considerations
- Event pooling for high-frequency events
- Memory management for event data
- Thread safety guarantees
- Profiling hooks
- Event batching for network optimization
- Event compression for reduced bandwidth

## Best Practices
- Keep event handlers lightweight and fast
- Unsubscribe from events when no longer needed
- Use appropriate event priorities
- Document event contracts and schemas
- Implement proper error handling
- Use event validation for security
- Consider event serialization for save games
- Profile event system performance regularly

## Integration Points
- Rules Engine
- Save System
- UI System
- AI System
- Network System
- Debug Tools

## Debugging and Monitoring
- Event logging with different verbosity levels
- Visual event flow visualization
- Performance metrics collection
- Event history inspection
- Debug overlays for in-game monitoring
