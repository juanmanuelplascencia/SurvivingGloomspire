# Phase 1: Pre-production

## Overview
This document outlines the pre-production phase of the Pathfinder 1e implementation, focusing on planning, design, and setup before active development begins.

## Goals
1. Define project scope and requirements
2. Establish technical foundation
3. Create development pipeline
4. Set up version control and project structure

## Milestones

### 1. Project Setup (Week 1-2)
- [ ] Initialize Unreal Engine 5 project
- [ ] Set up version control (Git)
- [ ] Create basic folder structure
- [ ] Configure project settings
- [ ] Set up development environment

### 2. Technical Design (Week 3-4)
- [ ] Design core architecture
- [ ] Plan data structures
- [ ] Design component system
- [ ] Plan network architecture
- [ ] Document technical design

### 3. Asset Pipeline (Week 5-6)
- [ ] Set up asset import/export pipeline
- [ ] Create asset naming conventions
- [ ] Set up version control for assets
- [ ] Create asset validation tools

## Detailed Tasks

### Project Setup
1. **Initialize Project**
   - Create new Unreal Engine 5 project
   - Enable required plugins
   - Set up source control
   - Create initial folder structure

2. **Version Control**
   - Set up .gitignore for Unreal projects
   - Configure Git LFS for binary assets
   - Set up branching strategy
   - Document workflow for team members

3. **Development Environment**
   - Set up Visual Studio/IDE
   - Configure build tools
   - Set up debugging tools
   - Document setup process

### Technical Design
1. **Core Architecture**
   - Design component system
   - Plan event/messaging system
   - Design save/load system
   - Plan network replication

2. **Data Structures**
   - Define core data types
   - Design database schema
   - Plan serialization format
   - Design configuration system

3. **UI/UX Design**
   - Create UI mockups
   - Design HUD layout
   - Plan menu flow
   - Document UI specifications

### Asset Pipeline
1. **Art Pipeline**
   - Set up sprite import settings
   - Configure animation tools
   - Set up material library
   - Create shader library

2. **Audio Pipeline**
   - Set up audio import settings
   - Configure sound classes
   - Plan music system
   - Set up voice processing

3. **Localization**
   - Set up text localization
   - Plan translation workflow
   - Create string tables
   - Set up culture settings

## Deliverables
1. Project setup documentation
2. Technical design document
3. Asset creation guidelines
4. Development environment setup guide
5. Initial project repository

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
1. **Unreal Engine 5 Learning Curve**
   - Mitigation: Schedule training sessions
   - Allocate extra time for learning

2. **Performance Issues**
   - Mitigation: Set performance budgets
   - Profile early and often

3. **Asset Pipeline Bottlenecks**
   - Mitigation: Automate asset processing
   - Create validation tools

### Schedule Risks
1. **Scope Creep**
   - Mitigation: Define MVP features
   - Regular scope reviews

2. **Dependency Delays**
   - Mitigation: Identify critical path
   - Have contingency plans

## Success Criteria
1. Working development environment
2. Approved technical design
3. Functional asset pipeline
4. Initial project structure in version control
5. Team trained on tools and processes

## Next Steps
1. Begin Phase 2: Core Systems Development
2. Set up CI/CD pipeline
3. Start implementing core systems
